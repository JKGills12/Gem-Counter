This assignment was an interactive game, utilizing the knowledge of HTML/CSS for the layout and design and jQuery for the actions of taking user interactions of the buttons to randomly produce numbers for each click of a button. 

The purpose of the game was to have the user click on crystal buttons that randomly generated numbers after each click and the user is to match the computer guessed number in order to win.

### PSEUDO CODE
// A GAME WITH 4 CRYSTALS AND RANDOM RESULT
// EVERY CRYSTAL NEEDS TO HAVE A RANDOM # BETWEEN 1-12
// A NEW RANDOM # SHOULD BE GENERATED EVERY SINGLE TIME WHETHER WE WIN OR LOSE TO THOSE 4 CRYSTALS
// WHEN CLICKING ANY CRYSTAL, IT SHOULD BE ADDING WITH THE PREVIOUS RESULTS UNTIL IT EQUALS TO THE TOTAL SCORE
// IF IT IS GREATER THAN THE RANDOM RESULT, THEN WE INCREMENT A LOSS
// IF IT IS EQUAL, THEN WE INCREMENT A WIN COUNTER
