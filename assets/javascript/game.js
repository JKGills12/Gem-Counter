// PSEUDO CODE
// A GAME WITH 4 CRYSTALS AND RANDOM RESULT
// EVERY CRYSTAL NEEDS TO HAVE A RANDOM # BETWEEN 1-12
// A NEW RANDOM # SHOULD BE GENERATED EVERY SINGLE TIME WHETHER WE WIN OR LOSE TO THOSE 4 CRYSTALS
// WHEN CLICKING ANY CRYSTAL, IT SHOULD BE ADDING WITH THE PREVIOUS RESULTS UNTIL IT EQUALS TO THE TOTAL SCORE
// IF IT IS GREATER THAN THE RANDOM RESULT, THEN WE INCREMENT A LOSS
// IF IT IS EQUAL, THEN WE INCREMEN A WIN COUNTER

// GLOBAL VARIABLES
var randomResult;
var lose;
var win;
